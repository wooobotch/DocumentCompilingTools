Document compiling tools!!

Why not?

Infinite options and not a single one of them seem to be what I'm looking for.

Maybe you are looking for a LaTeX compiler, or just want to get a PDF file out of other documents you already have.

This repo's goal is simple: take the script you think fits better and use it.

To prevent a *dependency hell* from every single installation I'm suggesting containerized fake installations; There is going to be a directory with a shell script or a Dockerfile and another script for it's addition/removal (we'll be adding things to the PATH).
